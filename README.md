# Martian_Frost_Identification
Project Overview This public repository focuses on the development of a classifier to distinguish images of Martian terrain with frost, contributing to the study of Mars' seasonal frost cycle and its impact on climate. The dataset, accessible from dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov, plays a crucial role in identifying low-latitude frosted microclimates.
